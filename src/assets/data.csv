aquatic,"Aquatic biomes consist of freshwater and marine ecosystems. Freshwater biomes are found on land and include ponds, rivers, and lakes, with a salt concentration lower than one percent. Meanwhile, marine biomes cover a significant portion of the Earth's surface, encompassing the open ocean, coral reefs, and estuaries."
grassland,"Grasslands are big open spaces filled with lots of grass and it's usually hot and not very rainy there. Imagine two kinds of grasslands: one where it's really warm called tropical grasslands, and another where it's not as warm called temperate grasslands. In the warm ones, there are a few trees, like in savannas, and they're mostly in Africa, Australia, India, and South America. The not-so-warm ones, like prairies and steppes, are in places like South Africa, Hungary, Argentina, Uruguay, North America, and Russia. These places don't have many trees or bushes, and they don't get a lot of rain like the warm ones. Some have tall grasses like in prairies, and others have shorter grasses like in steppes."
forest,"Forests are like big groups of trees all together. They cover about a third of the Earth and are homes to many animals like bugs, birds, and furry creatures. There are three main types of forests: warm forests with lots of rain called tropical forests, forests that change with the seasons called temperate forests, and really cold forests with lots of snow called boreal forests. They're all different because they're found in different places around the world."
desert,"Deserts are super dry places where it hardly ever rains. They cover about a fifth of the Earth. Some deserts are hot like an oven, and some are cold. Because deserts are so tough, not a lot of different plants and animals can live there. The ones that do live there have to be really good at surviving without much water. In deserts, you'll find animals like snakes and tiny mammals. There are different kinds of deserts, like hot ones, sort-of dry ones, ones by the ocean, and even cold ones."
tundra,"A tundra is a super cold place where it's really hard for plants and animals to live. It's like a freezer! The weather is very chilly, and it doesn't rain much, just a little bit. The ground is frozen, like ice, and the soil isn't very good for growing things. Tundras have two types: one is found way up in the North where it's super cold, and the other is on tall mountains. The plants in the tundra are simple, like small bushes and grasses. Some animals that live there have special ways to stay warm and find food because it's so cold and tough."
urban,"The urban biome refers to the human-made environments in cities and towns where people live, work, and interact. Unlike natural biomes, urban areas are shaped by human activities and structures."
